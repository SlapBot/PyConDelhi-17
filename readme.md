# PyConDelhi-17

This repository contains the information about community workspace held at [Pycon]https://in.pycon.org/) to describe Stephanie in Delhi on 7-8th November.

## Introduction

After a couple of talks at [PyData](https://github.com/SlapBot/PyDataDelhi-17) and [PyConf](https://github.com/SlapBot/PyConfHyd-17). I've figured to give a community workspace 
at Pycon where I could give a more hands-on demo about the overall functionality of Stephanie and set it up in their systems for them to interact and build powerful assistants over.
